# Handcrafted AI-Model
    Simple handcrafted AI project to classify satellite images into four classes (Water surfaces , desert,  forest,cloudy) with high accuracy â‰ˆ 98%



# Transfer learning Model 
    we Implemented this transfer learning model using ResNet50 with freezing its parameters so they don't update.


# Expanded Look at our project
    The attached PDF explains our project more with attached images so you can get understand more.

# Handcrafted Model Implementation 

    1. The model pic shows the model with layers and the parameters

    2. We Implemented early stopping and cross validation to ensure no overfitting occurs
